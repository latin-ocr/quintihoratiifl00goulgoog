ODE V.

Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa was a dishngrrished general, aad so
much estaemed hy Augustus, that he gave him his dsttghtar lulis
in marriage. Agrippa wished his achievements tos he celebrated
by Horace, who, while he excuses himself from the mors leborious
and responsible taslr of writing a formal poem, ingeniously pays
him the most flattering compliment He intimates that Agrippa’s
martial glory deserves the strains of a lostier genius than his own3
that his was the lyric muse, and iit only for hght or trifling sub·
jects3 but that Varius, gisted with the sublimest inspiratione of the
epic muse, would sing his praises in strains worthy nithe subject.

Most commentatore have thought this ode merely an excuse οι
Horace for not doing that which he had no disposition to do. But
the hrlness of the praises bestowed readers this conjecture super·
flacus. Itis probably only arr instance, among many, ofhis artini-
ly performing what he pretends to decline doing.
