ODE XIIL

The Romans believed that many 01 their gods passed their sum-

01 February, and to return 10 Arcadia on the 5111 01 December.
Both these days were observed by sacrifices and fastivity in hon-
or 01 Faunus, who was supposed 10 preside over their. flocks and
lields. This ode was probably written for one 01 his festivals.
ln the first part, the poet entreats Faunus, if he pays him due hon-
ors, to srnile upon his tields, and preserve the tender offspring 01
his tlocks3 and in the second, he sets forth the joy 01 the village
on the return 01 bis autumnal feast, when man und beust will re·
lax from their toil, and rejoiee in the bounty 01 their benefactor.

ODE xlv.

It seems that Murena had been chosen augur, and that several
01 his friends had met together in honor 01 the occasion 3 and that
among them were Horace, and another poet named Telephus, who
was a great scholar, and who undertook 10 entertain the company
with some grave 1100000100 00 ancient history. Horace interrupta
him by intimating that it were better to inquire where the best
wine was to be had, with the requisites for an entertainment, that
they might drink their friend’s health in honor 01 his new appoint-
ment. The hint succeeded, and we ure 10 imagine our poet in,
the midst 01 the entertainment, giving orders sor the manner 01
drinking, as though he were king 01 the 10001. ,
