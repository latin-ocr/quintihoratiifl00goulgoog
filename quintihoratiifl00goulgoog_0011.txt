to a complaint of asthma; and Augustus used to rally the two
poets, by saying, ‘⁴ that he sat between sighs and tears.” He had
a farm in the country of the Sabinas, and a house at Tibur, now
Tivoli, the ruins of which are still shown to strangers. He died
in his fifty-ninth year; so suddenly that he lebno will, and his

'l'he¹ writings of Horace have an air of frankness and openness
about them} a manly simplicity, and a contempt of affectation, or
the little pride of a vain and mean concealment, which, at once,

His epistles evince a knowledge ol the weaknesses of the human
heart, which would do honor to a professed philosopher. What
Quintilian, and the moderas atber him, call the “Art of Poetry,”
seems to have been onl the third epistle of the second boolr, ad.
dressed to the Pisos.' 'ihc style and manner differ in no respect
from the former epistles. The observatione are equally desultory,
aad we meet with the same strokes of satirical humor; which
appear unsuitable to a didactic pleae* ·
