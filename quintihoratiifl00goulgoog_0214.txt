ODE VI.

L. Munatius Plancus, a gentleman of fortune and ofconsular
dignity, had joined the republican party with Brutus and Cassius3
but aster the defeat of his part at Philippi, he joined Augrutiis.
He was cordially received, an treated with great respect hy Au-
gustus3 but being afterwards induced by the friends of Antony to
believe, that, with the aid of Cleopatra, the republicaus might sb‘ll
be successful, he went over to Antony. He found, however, that
things were less favorable than they had been represented, and
returned again to the ruling party. >Alter this he was not very
cordially received by Augustus. And feeling that he did not stand
well at court, he retired to his country seat at Tibur. Here, prob·

tc the severity of discipline to which its hihabitants submitted,
