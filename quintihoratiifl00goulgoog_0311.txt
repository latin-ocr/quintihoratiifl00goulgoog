This satire, written by way of dialogue,is intended to show tlrat
all mankind are either madmen or fools. Horace had retired in·
to the country during the Saturnalia Damasippus, a stoic phi·

human beart, are portreyed with inimitoble slrill. The whole
conversation is interspersed with moral reflectione aud usefirl
instruction. ' . ·
