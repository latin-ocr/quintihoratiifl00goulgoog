huus as ιο the meaning of these words There was at Ti ur,
now Theoti, a wood, aad nearita small lake or fountain, each called
abuma, from a Sibyl of that name, whose temple still remeius al-
most entire on the rock which causes and overhangs the first and
principd falls of the Anio st Tivoli. Some commentatore suppose
the poet speaks of-the country-seat of Plancus near this spot, and
some that he refers to a deep cavem iu the rock just below the
falls, into which the wetere rush with a grem uoise; while others

understand him to mean the temple of the Sibyl, who in her ne·
sponsas is represented asreiichoiug the roar oftlre waterfalls. 'This
temple is certainly a most interesting ruin, and it forms attha pres-
ent day one of the most strikingly pictoresque objecta in this scene
of unrivalled beauty.

lamis and from his then' Telamon, king of Salamis, seut his

junction that neither should return without his brother. When
Teucer retumed‚ aster the death of Ajax, he was baniahed by his
father, and went to Cyprus, where he built another Salamis. The
poet here reminds Plancus, that Teucer did not allow himself ιο
be depressed, although banished from ,his home aad counuy3 and
that he, therefore, should call some of his friends about him, aad
regain bis elastioity of spirit. ’

2. &barin . . .pcrdere: ‘why are you bastening to destroy Sy·

yielded to the allurements of sensuality, had abandoned his manly
exercises and his former oompanions, and was hastening to de-
stmction by that fatal infatuation which has led more youths to
perdition than the whole catalogue of other vices.
