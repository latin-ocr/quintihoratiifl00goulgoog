ODE XII.

AElius Lamias, to whom this ode was addressed, was a reon
of illustrious family and considerable estate. He had risenkey his

personal merit to the rank of hemmam-general in the Spnnisb
war under Augustus. He so demeaned himself in this office as to
gain the esteem and respect of the army. Horace therefore com-
pliments him on the heroditnry honors, which he so well sustain-
ed3 and upon which his own character and achievements bad shed
additional lustre. And since he predicts a sturm on the morrow,
he invites Lamias to pass the day with him.
